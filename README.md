# stressdrop
The following codes are in the support of the NSF Proposal (Award ID: 2204102) EAR-PF: Are large earthquakes like small earthquakes? Using synthetic earthquakes to resolve discrepancies in observations of earthquake stress drop magnitude-invariance. Although there were likely be modifications as needed, there are three main outputs of this code:
1) Generate synthetic source time functions for a defined earthquake stress drop using simple earthquake source models
2) Peform empirical Green's Function analyses with the synethic source time functions
3) Parameterize the complexity of the synthetic source models
